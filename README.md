# MandelbrotFPGA

Real time rendering of Madelbrot set to VGA output on Cyclone II FPGA Starter Development Kit.
Final project for course PV200: Introduction to hardware description languages at FI MUNI.

To try it yoursel, simply open the project in Quartus IDE (version 13.0 is required) an upload to the kit.
Mandelbrot set should appear on the VGA output @ 800 Ã— 600 px.
You can use switches to set the zoom level (most-left active switch guides the zoom level),  tactile switches
move around in VIM style (left down up right).
